# my-weather-app

## About this App
> This is a basic weather app that calls to the OpenWeatherMap.org API for current weather conditions in the city input by the user, as well as that city's 5 day forecast.  The background color of the app changes depending on the UV index for that day: green for favorable, yellow for moderate, and red for severe.

> This app was build using the OpenWeatherMap.org API, jQuery, UIkit for CSS styling, and Firebase. Note: the assignment called for students to use local storage; however, I chose to use Firebase instead since previous assignments used local storage. 

## Background
> As a tutor and TA for a coding bootcamp, I'm frequently asked questions on homework assignments.  While I could just look at the provided solutions, I prefer to create a solution "in my own writing".  This way, I can better help my students find their own problem solving solutions by explaining to them how I would go about the assignment.

## Need to Knows
> This app is built with Firebase and an API that requires an API key.  Since there is not a Node server attached to this app, the keys were removed for security purposes.  If a user would like to try this app, they will need to create a local copy and obtain their own keys.  A demo video will be posted soon showing the functionality of this app.
